### Healthcare-Specific Components

1. **Azure AD Authentication**: Healthcare organization single sign-on
2. **HIPAA Audit Logger**: Comprehensive compliance logging
3. **Healthcare Role Mapper**: Map AD groups to healthcare permissions
4. **Data Classification Engine**: Filter content based on security clearance
5. **Healthcare Knowledge Processor**: Specialized parsing for medical terminology

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.8+
- Azure AD tenant with healthcare organization
- ServiceNow instance with Knowledge Base configured (optional for mock mode)
- MCP-compatible client (like Claude Desktop or compatible IDE)

### Healthcare Environment Setup

1. **Configure Azure AD Integration**
   ```bash
   # Set up healthcare-specific environment
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-healthcare-tenant-id
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-healthcare-client-id
   ORGANIZATION_NAME="Your Healthcare Organization"
   HIPAA_COMPLIANCE_MODE=true
   ```

2. **Configure Healthcare User Groups**
   ```bash
   # Healthcare IT groups
   Healthcare_IT_L1=Level 1 Help Desk
   Healthcare_IT_L2=Level 2 Technicians  
   Healthcare_IT_Admin=IT Administrators
   Healthcare_Security=Security Team
   ```

3. **Start with Mock Healthcare Data**
   ```bash
   # Perfect for development and testing
   MOCK_MODE=true
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📖 Healthcare Usage Examples

### Epic EMR Support
```
